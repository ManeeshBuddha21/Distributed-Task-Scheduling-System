# Architecture Notes

- **Scheduling**: Java service promotes `pending` -> `queued` using a priority-first policy with age tiebreaker. It's deliberately DB-centric (no external queue) to keep ops simple.
- **Claiming**: Workers claim one at a time via `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` ensuring fairness and avoiding thundering herd.
- **Recovery**: Orchestrator requeues `in_progress` tasks whose `updated_at` has gone stale (worker crashed, network partition, etc.). Retries capped by `max_retries`.
- **Indexes**: `status, priority` and `updated_at` improve hot-path queries by ~40% on a 100k task dataset locally.
- **Why not Kafka/Rabbit?** Kept out for now; DB is good enough until we prove otherwise. Hooks exist to swap the queue out if needed.

## Potential extensions
- Multi-tenant fairness (token bucket per tenant)
- Rate limits per worker or queue
- Pluggable task executors beyond shell
- Batching for tiny tasks
- Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards
